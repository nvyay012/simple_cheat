This project provides a basic ammunition cheat for AssaultCube, implemented in C++. The cheat modifies the game's memory to ensure that the player always has unlimited ammunition, allowing for uninterrupted gameplay. The code works by locating the game's memory address that stores the player's current ammo count and then overriding it with a fixed value.
