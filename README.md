Memory Manipulation Example for Windows
This example demonstrates how to read and write memory in a running process using the Windows API. Specifically, it targets a game process to modify its memory values, such as setting a custom ammo count in a game.

Overview
The provided code performs the following tasks:

Retrieve the Base Address of a Module:

The GetModuleBaseAddress function uses CreateToolhelp32Snapshot and Module32First/Module32Next to find the base address of a module (e.g., the game's executable) within a process.
Read and Write Memory:

The GetPointerAddress function calculates a memory address by following pointers and offsets. This is useful for finding dynamic memory locations in applications.
The main function demonstrates how to locate the process and modify a specific memory value. In this case, it continuously sets the ammo value in a game to 1000.
Code Breakdown
Headers and Libraries:

The code includes standard Windows headers for process manipulation (Windows.h, TlHelp32.h) and standard C++ libraries (iostream, vector).
Functions:

GetModuleBaseAddress: Finds the base address of a specified module in the target process.
GetPointerAddress: Uses a base address and a series of offsets to find a target memory address.
Main Logic:

Retrieves the window handle of the target application (in this case, "AssaultCube").
Obtains the process ID and handle.
Uses the base address and offsets to locate the ammo memory address and continuously writes a value to it.
Usage
Compile and Run:

Compile the code using a C++ compiler that supports Windows API (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio).
Ensure that you have permissions to modify the target process's memory.
Adjustments:

Update the FindWindowA function parameter to match the target application's window title.
Modify gamemodule1, ammoAddr, and ammoOffsets to match the target application's module and memory layout.
Caution
Ethical Considerations:

This code is provided for educational purposes only. Using memory manipulation to alter software behavior can violate terms of service and lead to unintended consequences.
Security:

Directly manipulating process memory can be risky and should be done with care to avoid crashes or corrupting data.
